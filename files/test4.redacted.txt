Per discussion with █     █     , Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for ▇ ▇ ▇ ▇ . For ▇ ▇ , we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals ( to protect against zone allocations ) and we want to " schedule " the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to ▇ in the final nomination cycle . We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage . Please confirm our firm rights for all ▇ of our Alliant Energy Utilities . We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints . █     █     , █     █     , Gas Trader - Alliant Energy,(608 ) 252 - 3078 PH,(608 ) 252 - 3130      FAX
